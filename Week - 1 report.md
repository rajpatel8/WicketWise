## Project Overview

**Project Title:** Video Annotation Platform for Cricket Coaching  
**Business Partner:** Become Better  
**Team Lead:** 
**Date:** May 29th, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

We are developing a comprehensive mobile-first video annotation platform specifically designed for cricket coaches to streamline their training feedback process. The platform enables real-time video capture, frame-accurate annotations, and multimedia feedback delivery - all optimized for on-field coaching scenarios.

## Technical Architecture Decision: Native Mobile vs Web Application

### Why Native Mobile Over Web Application?

While a traditional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application would naturally lean toward web development for its simplicity and cross-platform accessibility, our cricket coaching platform presents unique technical requirements that demand native mobile implementation.

### Core Technical Requirements Analysis

#### **Video Processing Demands**
- **Real-time video capture** during live cricket training sessions
- **Frame-by-frame annotation** with millisecond precision
- **Hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding** for smooth playback
- **GPU-intensive graphics rendering** for overlay annotations
- **Low-latency processing** for immediate coach feedback

#### **Hardware Integration Needs**
- **Camera access** for live session recording
- **Touch-based drawing** for precision annotations
- **Gyroscope/accelerometer** for device orientation during recording
- **Storage optimization** for large video files
- **Battery efficiency** for extended training sessions

## Platform-Specific Technical Advantages

### ‚úÖ **ANDROID IMPLEMENTATION**

#### **Core Video Processing APIs**
1. **MediaCodec** ‚Äì Hardware-accelerated video encoding/decoding for processing annotated cricket videos efficiently
2. **MediaExtractor** ‚Äì Extracts raw video frames to enable per-frame cricket event annotation
3. **SurfaceView / SurfaceTexture** ‚Äì Renders video frames to the GPU, allowing real-time preview with annotations
4. **OpenGL ES / Vulkan** ‚Äì Draws annotation graphics (player markers, pitch maps, ball trajectory) directly on GPU surfaces
5. **CameraX / Camera2** ‚Äì Captures live cricket footage for real-time annotation during gameplay

#### **Performance Benefits**
- **Hardware acceleration** leverages device GPU for smooth 60fps annotation rendering
- **Native memory management** prevents video processing bottlenecks
- **Direct hardware access** eliminates web browser limitations

### ‚úÖ **iOS IMPLEMENTATION** (Future Phase)

#### **Core Frameworks**
1. **AVFoundation** ‚Äì Core framework for reading, annotating, and exporting cricket videos with timeline precision
2. **VideoToolbox** ‚Äì Fast hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding for processing annotated frames
3. **Core Image + Core Animation** ‚Äì Applies visual cricket annotations (lines, text, zones) to video frames
4. **Metal / MetalKit** ‚Äì GPU-accelerated rendering of complex overlays for smooth annotation playback
5. **Vision Framework** ‚Äì AI-powered player detection and tracking for automatic annotation assistance
